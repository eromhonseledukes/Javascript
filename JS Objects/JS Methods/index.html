<!--methods are behaviour of an object/entities. two types f methods ie built in methods and custom methods. built in method comes with javascript language, you dont create it when writing , just call them into the programme, but custom methods are created by programmer or software developer , methods are always associated with an object, you can seperate a method from an object, a-->
<!--A function can stand on its own, its independent of an object and its a reusable piece of code-->
<!--we have objects that are built in to javascrip just like we have built in methods-->

<!--Documents objects
A Document object is the route node of an html document-->

    <!--Difference between document.write and Document.writeln is 
    when you use write line the document will display on a new line, while write will display on the same line-->
    <!--'<pre>' means preformatted tag-->
    <script>document.write('<pre>')
    document.writeln("my first javascript method  ");
    document.writeln("Java lovers");

    <!--Functions-->
    <!--different types of function are 
    1. alert function. used for displaying a dialogue box, with an ok button
    2. confirm function. It displays a dialogue box with two buttons ie ok and cancel buttons eg when you want to delete or close a file, you get a dialogue button asking if you want to close a file or delete. thats a confirm box
     3. parseInt function: parse meansn to convert while Int means interger, which is convert a string to interger. 
     4. parseFloat: Converts a string into a number with decimal point
     5. prompt function: Used for displaying a dialogue box that accept an input value through a text box
     6. IsNAN function: used to check whether a value is not a number-->

     <script>
     var value=""
     var num1 = prompt("enter first value to perform the multiplication operation", value);
     var num2 = prompt("enter second value to perform the multiplication operation", value);
     var result=eval(num1*num2)
     document.write("result of multiplying "+ num1 + "and" + num2 +" is "+ result + ".");

     </script>

     <script>
        var loanAmount = prompt("Enter loan amount ($) :", "");
        var loanDuration = prompt("Enter loan duration (in years) :", "");
        loanAmount = parseFloat(loanAmount);
        loanDuration = parseInt(loanDuration);
        var interestRate = 8;
        var interestAmount, totalAmount;
        
        if(isNaN(loanAmount) || isNaN(loanDuration) || loanAmount <= 0 || loanDuration <= 0){
            alert("please enter valid number for loan amount or loan duration");
        }
        // using Operators: assignment, multiplication, division operator
        else{
            interestAmount = (loanAmount * interestRate * loanDuration)/100;
            totalAmount = loanAmount + interestAmount;
            document.write("<b>Total amount to be paid ($):</b> " + totalAmount.toFixed(2) + "<br />");
        }
        // increment and decrement oporators
        // Used for increasing or decreasing the value of a variable by 1
        var number =3;
        alert("number after increment ="+ --number)// will return 2
        //Logical Operators: Binary operators that performs logical operation on 2 operands

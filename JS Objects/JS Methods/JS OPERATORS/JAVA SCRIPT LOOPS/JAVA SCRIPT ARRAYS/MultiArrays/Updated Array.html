    // ARRAYS
    // arrays are collections of values stored in adjacent memory locations
    // they are also collections of values of similar data types
    // arrays help in efficient management of your system memory space.

    //EXAMPLE
    // To write a program that stores the names of a thousand Employees
    // you can use a single array name to store the names of the employee instead of declaring a variable for each employee
    // All elements in an array must be of a similar data type, i.e., integers or strings
    // Array index (index of array) is known as the position of the array element
    // values of arrays are also referred to as the elements of the array
    // 2 types of Array-- Single Dimension and Multi-dimensional arrays
    // Single-Dimension array: All elements are stored in a single row in the allocated memory location
    // length of an array is fixed at declaration
    // arrays start indexing from zero. the first element starts from zero

    var marital_status = ['Single', 'Married', 'Divorced'];

    alert('List of marital status: \n' + marital_status[0] + ', ' + marital_status[1] + ', ' + marital_status[2]);

    // Multi-dimensional Arrays

    // Stores combinations of values of a single type in two or more dimensions

    // Define a multi-dimensional array to store employee details
var employees = [
    ["John Doe", 30, "Software Engineer"],
    ["Jane Smith", 25, "UX Designer"],
    ["Michael Johnson", 35, "Project Manager"],

];


// Function to display all employee details
function displayEmployees() {
    var employeeDetails = "Employee Details:\n";
    employees.forEach(function(employee, index) {
        employeeDetails += "Employee " + (index + 1) + ":\n";
        employeeDetails += "Name: " + employee[0] + "\n";
        employeeDetails += "Age: " + employee[1] + "\n";
        employeeDetails += "Position: " + employee[2] + "\n";
        employeeDetails += "------------------------\n";
    });
    alert(employeeDetails);
}

// Function to add a new employee
function addEmployee() {
    var name = prompt("Enter the employee's name:");
    var age = parseInt(prompt("Enter the employee's age:"));
    var position = prompt("Enter the employee's position:");
    employees.push([name, age, position]);
    alert("New employee added successfully!");

// Function to remove an employee by name

    var name = prompt("Enter the name of the employee to remove:");
    var index = -1;

        alert(name + " has been removed from the employees list.");
    } else {
        alert("Employee not found!");
    }

// Example usage:

// Display all employee details
displayEmployees();

// Add a new employee
addEmployee();

// Display all employee details after addition
displayEmployees();

// Remove an employee by name
removeEmployeeByName();

// Display all employee details after removal
displayEmployees();

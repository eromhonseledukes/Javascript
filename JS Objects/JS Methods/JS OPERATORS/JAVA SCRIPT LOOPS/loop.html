        //LOOPS are block of codes or statements that are executed repeatedly or multiple times.
        //loops are  widely used when you want to display a series of numbers or accept repititive inputs
        // like you want write a programme to count from zero to one thousnd or one million
        // There are three(3) different types of loops. All can be used to achieve same result

        // 1. while Loop    2. for loop.   3. do-while loop

        // 1. while loop:   Execute a block of codes as long as given condition remain true

        // Example is to write a programm to add the sum of 1o numbers

        // initialisation section: Determines the entry or starting point of the loop
        var i = 0;
        var sum = 0;

        // conditional section: This determine where the loop should stop
        // any loop without a conditional section is an infinite or endles loop
        while(i <= 20){    // condition
            sum = sum + i;    // statement 1

            // increment and decrement section: Determines the progress of the loop
            i = i + 1;        // statement 2
        }
        alert(`sum of first 20 numbers: ` + sum);

        // 2. for loop: also has initialisation, conditional and increments/decrement section 
        // it write a programme using a forloop that will accept any randon number from user and it will generate the first 10 multiples of that number

        var inputNum = prompt('Enter any number : ');
        var result = 0;
        document.write(`multiples of : ` + inputNum + '<br />');
        for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
            result = inputNum * i;
            document.write(inputNum + ` * ` + i + ` = ` + result + '<br />');
        }
        // Difference btw a function and a method is that function is usually independent of an object. A method is not independent of an object. At above prompt if a function bcos is not associated with an object while write is a method


        //3. do-while
        // both while and do-while are similar in the sence that they both executes a condition until it becomes false
        // difference is that do-while loop starts with do keyword and executes the body of the loop at least once b4 evaluating the condition
        
        //EXAMPLE 1
        var answer = '';
        do {
        answer = prompt('Capital of Nigeria:','');
        }
        while (answer != 'Abuja');
        alert('Capital of Nigeria is: '+ answer);
